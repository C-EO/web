# CONTRIBUTING

## Contributing to Nitely

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Nitely!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

### Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qedTfxVDRP).

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

### Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

See the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.

### Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Nitely? Have a feature/app request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

#### Identify Where to Report

The Nitely project has multiple issues open [here](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues) and [here](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/issues).

#### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/issues) to see if the issue or feature/app request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature/app, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

#### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature/App Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature/app request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature/app requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of the app **\(OPTIONAL\)**
* Your operating system **\(OPTIONAL. Although it helps a lot if we know the OS.\)**
* Reproducible steps \(1... 2... 3...\) that cause the issue **\(OPTIONAL. But also helps a lot if we know exactly what you did.\)**
* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring **\(OPTIONAL\)**
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue \(Please not that you don't need to use backticks to write your code. It will automatically be rendered into shell.\)
  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file \(i.e. .gif\) is not sufficient.
* Errors from the Log Output. **\(You can find this under Preferences -&gt; Nitely Settings -&gt; Log Files. This is the same as a code snippet.\)**

#### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issues to ensure your report is a new issue
* [ ] Recreate the issue
* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

#### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the [issue tracking](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/wiki/Issue-Tracking) workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.

### Automated Issue Management

We use GitHub Actions to help us manage issues. These Actions and their descriptions can be [viewed here](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/actions). Some examples of what these Actions do are:

* Automatically closes any issue marked `Needs More Info` if there has been no response in the past 7 days.
* Automatically lock issues 45 days after they are closed.

If you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.

### Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please see [How to Contribute](https://github.com/C-EO/nitely/wiki/How-to-Contribute) in the wiki.
